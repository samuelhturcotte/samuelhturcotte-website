                    My name is Samuel Turcotte, a creative and detail-oriented Front-End Developer with a UX Design education background.<br/><br/>
                    As a hard-of-hearing individual, Iâ€™ve had to overcome many different challenges throughout my life. It has made me someone that 
                    can adapt to all sorts of environments and find creative solutions to any problems I can face both in life as well as when it comes to web development.<br /><br />
                    Getting a UX education gave me a good understanding of the full process which helps me see the bigger picture and bridge the gap between designers and developers. 
                    It has also given me a sharp eye for detail that helps me build aesthetic, usable, and well-designed software.<br /><br />
                    Over time I discovered a love for turning my design into fully functioning software which made me want to learn coding which I can now consider my passion. 
                    I am a proud self-taught developer with professional experience, and I am constantly striving to learn more and always get better.<br /><br />
                    My life experiences, education and tech passion have truly helped me become an asset in any project I am working on and cannot wait to continue 
                    developing my skillset and career over the next coming years.
