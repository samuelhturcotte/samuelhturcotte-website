                    My name is Samuel Turcotte, a creative and detail-oriented UI/UX Designer with Front-End Web development experience.<br/><br/>
                    As a hard-of-hearing individual, Iâ€™ve had to overcome many different challenges throughout my life. It has made me someone that 
                    can adapt to all sorts of environments and find creative solutions to overcome any accessible issues I can face both in life as 
                    well as when it comes to digital design.<br /><br />
                    Getting a UX education gave me all the knowledge and tools to design and manage digital products at any stage of the process while
                    always focusing on users' needs to create usable and user-centric products. It has also allowed me to learn all the fundamental principles
                    of user interface design and develop a sharp eye for detail that helps me build well-structured and aesthetically pleasing applications and websites.<br /><br />
                    Throughout my time working in the industry as a front-end web developer, I have been able to develop my coding skills which give me the possibility to take a design
                    to a real functioning product. It has also given me the flexibility to work with different teams and become an asset when it comes to bridging the gap between designers and developers.<br /><br />
                    My life experiences, education and passion for tech have helped me every day in designing and building amazing digital products that have a positive impact on people's lives and I cannot wait 
                    to continue growing my skillset and evolving in my career over the next coming years.
